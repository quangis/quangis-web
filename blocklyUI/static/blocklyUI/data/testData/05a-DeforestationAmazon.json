Due to deforestation, current estimates indicate only about 80 percent of the original rain forest remains. In this lesson, you'll use ArcGIS Pro to create a map of deforestation in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. Then, you'll predict how much deforestation would be caused by a road proposed to be built across the state. Your workflow requires a wide variety of data, feature editing, and analysis tools. You'll also learn how to share your results as an informative print map."
